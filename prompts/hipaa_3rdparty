As a reminder, these parameters are data subject, sender, recipient, data type, and transmission principle.  Now consider the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which describes different ways that information may be shared.  I will now ask you to verify if the follow informational flows are permitted under HIPAA.  Assume that the sender acts as a business associate to a covered entity, and thus falls under HIPAA jurisdiction.  Please format your response according to answer==**yes/no**.  For example, if the informational flow is not permitted under HIPAA, then please format the response as answer==**no**.  Once you have written down this format, please also provide a reason why you answered in that way.  When providing an answer, please perform the following steps: \n state who the data subject is \n state who has provided consent \n determine if the data subject has provided consent \n answer yes or no if the informational flow is permitted \n reason about the answer.  Keep in mind that a visitor is not the same person as the owner.  In addition, keep in mind that this informational flow is intended for medical treatment of the data subject.  Ready?"
